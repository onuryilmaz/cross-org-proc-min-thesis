\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\label{chp:introduction}

Process mining is a relatively young and developing research area with the roots in computational intelligence, data mining; and process modeling and analysis \cite{van2012process}. Main idea in this research area is to discover, monitor and improve processes by extracting information from event logs. With this idea, process mining creates a bridge between data mining and business process modeling and analysis. Interest in this research area has two origins; firstly, events are recorded and easily available in the modern information systems. Secondly, highly competitive and rapidly changing business life requires improvement and support for business processes \cite{van2012process}. Traditional process mining approaches work on a single organization; however, with the increase of cloud computing and shared infrastructures, event logs of multiple organizations are currently available for analysis. In principle, there are two main environments where cross-organizational process mining stands out. Firstly, when organizations work together to execute the same process, it is insufficient to analyze only logs of one organization and gathered information from all stakeholders should be merged prior to analysis. Secondly, organizations essentially execute the same processes with different needs and configurations on a common infrastructure, where cross-organizational process mining can help the organizations to learn from each other's experience, knowledge and processes.

Process mining spectrum is extensive and highly inter-related with a different sets of activities grouped under categories of \textit{Cartography}, \textit{Auditing} and \textit{Navigation} \cite{van2011process}. In this spectrum, \textit{Cartography} activities aim to create maps of the real world tasks by using process models whereas \textit{Auditing} activities confront the models and reality; and the last activity group of \textit{Navigation} activities use process mining methods like a navigation application. This thesis study proposes a hybrid approach and exploits approaches from different categories to create a new point of view. In other words, this study aims to create maps using the discovery techniques from \textit{Cartography} and promotes the better operating locations in the process models from \textit{Auditing} to create recommendations for users like a \textit{Navigation} application. 

In cross-organizational process mining area, recent studies focus on commonality and collaboration between organizations; however, they only present results based on how similar the process models and behaviors of organizations under cross comparison \cite{buijs2012towards}. In addition, challenges based on partitioning of tasks and process models between organizations are presented in the literature \cite{van2011intra}. This thesis study is based on the environment where processes are executed on several organizations and cross-organizational process mining is applied with the idea of unsupervised learning where predictor variables related to performances of organizations are used.

Recent studies in process mining and similarity area  include various different approaches to define relationships between process models. These studies include creating similarity metrics for node matching, structural and behavioral similarities \cite{dijkman2011similarity} and alignment matrices between models \cite{buijs2014comparing}. In addition, differences between process models are tried to be explained by mismatch patterns with the help of comprehensive case studies \cite{dijkman2007mismatch}. In this study, mismatch patterns are mathematically defined and implemented; as it is known to be the first implementation of mismatch patterns. Applicability and performance of using mismatch patterns is also analyzed by comparing to the similarity metrics that are defined in the literature. 

In the light of these motivations, approach proposed in this thesis study is a four-stage solution and it starts by mining the process models of organizations with a user defined noise threshold. With the mined models and event logs, second stage calculates the performance indicators for each organization and then clusters organizations based on how well they are operating. Third stage aims to find differences between process models of each organization. Final stage combines the information from all stages and provides a set of recommendations. With this approach it is aimed to help business process management users to focus on the potentially important parts of their business maps. In addition, this approach includes implementation of mismatch patterns and performance indicator based clustering of organizations. As an extensible framework, approach stages are designed with minimum inter-dependency and they are open to include new process mining approaches, performance indicators, clustering approaches and mismatch patterns. Moreover, every stage of the methodology is intended to be configurable for user needs and business environment requirements.

Within this thesis study, proposed methodology is implemented in ProM framework \cite{verbeek2010prom} as a set of plugins corresponding for each stage and packaged under the name of \textit{CrossOrgProcMin}. Since ProM is the most popular open-source environment for academia and industry at the time of this thesis published, developed set of plugins are built over this framework. With the help of this implementation, approach proposed in this thesis is tested on a synthetic and real-life event logs. Performance of methodology is assessed with a defined evaluation metrics for each stage and resulting recommendations are presented to show how this approach helps users to focus on learning opportunities between organizations with a performance improvement potential.
