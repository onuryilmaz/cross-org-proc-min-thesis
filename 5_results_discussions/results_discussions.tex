\section{Evaluation Metrics}
\label{sec:evaluation-metrics}
Approach in this study is an aggregation of various methods and they are significantly different from each other in their mathematical background. Therefore, instead of a global evaluation metric for the complete methodology, each stage will be evaluated within its evaluation metrics. Since these stages are executed sequentially, it is important for each stage to perform enough well to yield a successful outcome. In this section, evaluation metrics for each stage will be presented and they will be used to determine the success of methodology on experiments.
